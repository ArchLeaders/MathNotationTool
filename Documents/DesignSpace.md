# Programming 11 - Design Space

## My Design Space

<!-- What do you know about your design space with regards to tools and technology, setup, availability, and geography? -->

My design space consists of a physical workplace, various online resources and software, and a passion to learn new things.

Over the last year, I have developed my workspace with better equipment to improve productivity even more. And with my current role as a student, I have free licensed access to Autodesk's lineup of software for personal and educational use. My passion for this along with my current employment as a software developer keeps me on track and motivated to learn and expand my programming knowledge.

<!--  What boundaries are there to your design space?
Limiting factors that might make it difficult for you to complete your design include available technology, knowledge, time, expense, environmental impact, and copyright.
Include a detailed explanation of the limiting factors.  -->

### Restraints & Limitations

The primary underlying issue when creating anything is time. There is simply too much to do and learn to have _extra_ time in the day. This is never a reason not to do something, it just means I need to make good use of that time by being efficient and focused on the current objective.

Knowledge, or rather, a lack of it, is also a restraint. Although you could argue that lack of knowledge is just the time needed to learn; so I will rephrase that statement: lack of knowledge is not a restraint, just something that can slow you down.

There are many more limitations of course, but those two are the most common limitations in my experience, leaving out one-off occurrences and responsibilities in the world around us.

### Quality vs Time

<!--  What steps will you take to ensure the quality of your final product?  -->

How much **time** do you spend making your product the best it can be? When is it *good enough*?
And how can you ensure the steps taken to reach that **quality** are effective and productive?

These questions are very much subjective to your own standards of **quality**. This is why we need other, non-influenced, honest sources, to give **feedback** on our product. This way we can assure that the quality is not just to your standards, but to the audience's standards as well.

We can also use this feedback to make productive changes to our product with a focused objective.

## Learning & Demonstrating

### How I Learn and Refine my Programming Skills

Learning, specifically in regard to programming, can be done in many different ways. I typically read or watch someone else's teaching, look at documentation and examples of the subject, reach out to the online community for help, or if all else fails, just use trial and error until something works.

The more practice with this, the easier it becomes to learn this way.

### The Resources I use to Program and Learn

Setting aside obvious things, like sustenance to stay alive, and a physical environment to work in, most programmers at the very least need these three things:

**1.** A computer. Typically one with a working OS, although this isn't required if you have uncommon skill in programming with machine code.
**2.** Internet access. Again, this one isn't strictly necessary, but most people need it for online learning resources and possibly the distribution of the final product.
**3.** An input device _(e.g. a keyboard)_. You could argue that this is included in the first resource, a computer. But technically you could have a computer without an input device. Even the most low-level machine code programming requires some way to send input to the computer. Even if it's just a power button.

So that's the bare minimum, luckily, most programmers have a bit more luxury than just those three things.
I'll go over what I use in my everyday programming.

#### Hardware

- Two monitors to see what my computer is going to do before it does it.
- Two input devices that do all the hard work sending messages to the operating system.
- A pair of trusted headphones to keep distractions out.
- And more small devices working to make billions of electric signals seamlessly communicate in a matter of nanoseconds with every click of a button.

#### Software

- Google. A web engine that makes learning resources easily accessible with just a few words.
- GitHub. This online software makes tracking and managing projects easy and hassle-free.
- Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, are two production IDEs to develop software as efficiently and easily as possible. <!--  Microsoft. You make great software man, but please, cut it with the vaccines already.  -->
- And various other peices of software.

### How Much Time do I Spend Learning

Learning programming is a never-ending process. After programming for over a year, I have become proficient with many aspects of it, but I am still learning new things on a daily basis.

There is no defined time for how much I learn, I am always practicing on a subject, refining my skills, or learning a completely new topic.

### My Timeline

My timeline is just a step behind whatever needs to be done in my current employment or personal project. I don't set a time for learning, I just learn when I need the knowledge.

### How I Demonstrate my Knowledge

This question very much depends on the situation and context. But in general, I demonstrate my knowledge by making software with that knowledge and showing that it works as intended, and was made in the set timeline.
