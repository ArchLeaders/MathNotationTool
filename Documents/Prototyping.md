# Programming 11 - Prototyping

- **Concept:** A tool for math notation using C-like code syntax
<br>

- **Intial Ideas:**
  1. Node based editor with a simplified controls to mimic code instructions that can be executed to perform simple math functions.
  2. Simple text editor using a C-like lexical analysis and support similar instructions that can be executed.
  3. Similar text editor (possibly without execute features), but with an attached calculator interface for simple math functions.

### Idea #1
> _"Node based editor with a simplified controls to mimic code instructions that can be executed to perform simple math functions."_

This, like most of the other ideas in this scope, is a small scale web or desktop application meant primarily for personal use. Feedback will also be requested during development to ensure a good final quality.

I will use [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/xd.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/ca/products/illustrator.html) for some basic UI layout planning and icon design. For the actual programming, I use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the DotNET SDK and Avalonia UI framework templates to start a new web/desktop application.

- Procedures
  - Basic UI design with XD
  - Document features in the design prototype.

### Idea #2
> _"Simple text editor using a C-like lexical analysis and support similar instructions that can be executed."_

This is also be a small scale web or desktop application for personal use. I will use the same methods using feedback to unsure a balanced level of detail is put into the product.

(Production tools would also remain the same for this idea.)

- Procedures
  - Basic UI design with XD
  - Document features in the design prototype.

### Idea #3
> _"Similar text editor (possibly without execute features), but with an attached calculator interface for simple math functions."_

Again, this is aiming to be small scale web or desktop application for personal use. And feedback will be used to constructively build the product to meet the audience's expectations.

(Production tools remain the same for this idea as well.)

- Procedures
  - Basic UI design with XD
  - Document features in the design prototype.
