# Programming 11 - Ideating

### What can you do to mitigate the boundaries and limiting factors you identified with regards to your design space?

There are few limitations with my design idea except time, which can only be mitigated by being more focused and time efficient.

### What have other people created? What can you change in other designs to make a new design?

I have not currently found any designs that are quite what I have in mind for this project. But, in general, making a new design from an existing one depends on what you're making, who your audience is, and how your idea differs from another's design.

### How do competing social, ethical, and sustainability considerations impact design solutions to meet global needs for optimal future living?

Most of my personal/community projects have little impact from these considerations. And concerns in corporation level work have been handled by the company well before production in my experience.

### Consider the list of your design ideas. How will you prioritize which ideas to work with users to design and prototype?

The priority of each design on a per-product scale depends on demand and motivation. In a case where no external input drives a product, I prioritize simply based off which idea I feel like working on.
