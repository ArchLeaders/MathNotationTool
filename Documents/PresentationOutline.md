## Math Notation Tool
> How can you or others build on your concept?

### Summary

Math Notation Tool is designed to let users easily read and write math problems with a few handy quality-of-life features built in.

### Body

-> Math Notation Tool is a desktop application that lets you denote math problems in C# and then execute the notation to evaluate the result. It also comes with a built-in calculator, which manages smaller-scale calculations to get used with the internal query function.

**show app screenshot on slide*<br>
-> In this example, we use standard C# math operators and variables with the built-in query function to denote a simple math problem in the editor. Finally, we return the evaluated results, as seen in the last line of the example notation.

**bullet point list of possible improvements*<br>
-> Even with all those features in place, there's still definite room for improvement. Such as advanced algebraic and binary math symbols in the built-in calculator, support for external C# libraries to help with complex algorithms, and better performance and ease of use throughout the application. And because the project is fully open-source, everyone is free to request changes to help add new features and fixed like these.

## Design Process
> What design processes worked well? Which ones need revision?

### Summary

**Cool, design process graphic or smth*

### Body

The general design process for this project followed a set of abstract steps (idea > prototype > test (re-iterate) > build > debug) that were followed and expanded to meet the project's goals. The same design process was used all the way to this point in the project, and although the design process wasn't revised, the individual steps were changed in various ways to meet new project requirements.

## Future Goals
> What new design goals do you have?

### Summary

- Advanced Math Functions
  - Bitwise operations
  - Algebraic expressions
- Improved performance and stability
  - Ahead of time JIT compilation (speed up first code execution)
  - Non-destructive error handling

### Body

The future of this project primarily depends on the overall success of the concept. Assuming the idea is well received, adding support for more advanced math and improving the application performance would be my first goal in upgrading the software. Followed by working the system into a web-based application to allow features like mobile access, project sharing, and a hosted account system.
