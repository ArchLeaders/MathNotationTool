## Math Notation Tool
> How can you or others build on your concept?

<!-- By adding more features :bigbrain: -->

### Summary

Math Notation Tool is designed to let users easily read and write math problems with a few handy quality of life features built in.

### Body

-> Math Notation Tool is a desktop application that lets you denote math problems in C#, and most importantly, execute the notation to quickly evaluate the result. It also comes with a built-in calculator, this can be used to manage smaller calculations that can be referenced through the internal query function.

**show app screenshot on slide*<br>
-> In this example, we see that we can use normal C# math operators and variables, as well as the built-in query function to get a calculation from the calculator panel on the right. The combination of these features can then be used to return a final calculation, as seen in the last line of the example code.

**bullet point list of possible improvments*<br>
-> Even with all those features in place, there's still definite room for improvment. Things such as advanced algebraic and binary math symbols could be added to the built-in calculator, support for using external C# libraries to help with complex algorithms, and of course general performance and ease of use can always be improved upon. And because the project is fully open-source, everyone is free to make there own changes and fixed to help build the project.

## Design Process
> What design processes worked well? Which ones need revision?

### Summary

**cool design process graphic or smth*

### Body

The general design process for this project followed a set of abstract steps (idea > prototype > test (re-iterate) > build > debug) that were followed and expanded to meet the projects goals. That design process was followed to this point in the project, and although the design process itself was never revised, the indiviual abstract steps were changed in various ways to meet new project requirments.

## Future Goals
> What new design goals do you have?

### Summary

- Advanced Math Functions
  - Bitwise operations
  - Algerbraic expressions
- Improved Performce and Stability
  - Ahead of time JIT compilation (speed up first code execution)
  - Non-destructive error handlings

### Body

The future of this project primarily depends on the overall success of the concept; but assuming the idea is well reveiced, I think adding support for more adnvanced math topics and improving the overal performace and stability of the application would be my first goal in a possible version two of the software.
