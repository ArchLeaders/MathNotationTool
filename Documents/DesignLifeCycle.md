# Programming 11 - Design Life Cycle

### Math Notation Tool, Prototype
> **Using Idea #2:** _"Simple text editor using a C-like lexical analysis and support similar instructions that can be executed."_

- Extraction and transportation of Raw Materials
  - **Impact:** My design does not use any raw resources or materials directly. I would not consider this to have any impact on my design.

- Manufacturing
  - **Impact:** Manufacturing, as I know it, is only applicable to physical production and is therefore not applicable to my design.

- Packaging
  - **Impact:** No physical resources will be used in the packaging of my design (e.g. Disks, Thumbdrives, etc).

- Transportation to Markets
  - **Impact:** No physical distribution is considered for this design.
  <!--  Why markets specifically? Seems a bit odd.  -->

- Servicing or Providing Replacement Parts <u>(Translating roughly to "bug fixes")</u>
  - **Impact:**  Bugs are very common and expected is any design. But it will not significantly impact my design over any other design.

- Expected Usable Lifetime
  - **Impact:** Until the underlying framework is unsupported by future OS's.

- Reuse or Recycling of Component Materials
  - **Impact:** The virtual materials used in my design (e.g. frameworks, SDK's, base code, etc) are highly reusable until they become out of date.

- **What criteria will you use to decide on the prototype with the optimal design life cycle?**
  - A prototype with minmal environemntal impacts and good reusability and sustainability.
  <br>
- **What limiting factors are there to choosing this prototype for your final design?**
  - None at this stage, except the time needed to create it.
  <br>

- **What importance would design life cycle have to Christians?**
  - <!-- Depends on the Christian. -->
